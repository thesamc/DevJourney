# Dev Journey - Interactive Development Blog

A dynamic, interactive development blog built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This project showcases my journey in web development through an engaging card-based interface with flip animations and a neon-themed design.

## Features
- Interactive flip cards with detailed content
- Custom typing animation for subtitle

- Fully responsive design across all devices

## Built With
- HTML5
